      *Title*: Oil And Water and Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation\
      *Supervisor*: [Lorenzo Taggi](https://sites.google.com/site/lorenzotaggiswebpage2/)

      *Short description*: Oil And Water and Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation are two randomly interacting particle systems on graphs. We considered, for both, two questions:
      - the phase transition with respect to the initial particle density between the two regimes of fixation and activity;
      - internal aggregation. Oil And Water has not a complete theory about internal aggregation, hence we analyzed a conjecture and introduced a new simpler model not present in the literature, with the same cluster growth rate as Oil And Water.
      We also compared the particles distributions on the clusters of the models and analyzed their fluctuations.

#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# My secondary interests are stochastic calculus, particle systems, and finance.

## Welcome!

I am a second year Ph.D. candidate in [Mathematics](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/) at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) in the [probability group](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/research/research-areas/mathematics/probability/).\
I am supervised by [Alberto Chiarini](https://www.math.unipd.it/~chiarini/) and cosupervised by [Giambattista Giacomin](https://www.math.unipd.it/~giacomin/).\
I am interested in probability, specializing in statistical mechanics, in particular on stochastic interface models in random environment.\
I have a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor's in Mathematics, both from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home/).
