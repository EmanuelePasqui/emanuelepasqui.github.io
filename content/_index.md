        I am working in the field of randomly fluctuating interfaces, which arises naturally in the context of coexistence of two homogeneous phases and is studied in a variety of statistical mechanics models.\
        <img align="right" width="250" height="300" src="GFF_per_github.png">I am currently working on the Gaussian free field in random environment with [Alessandra Cipriani](https://sites.google.com/site/aciprian41/) and [Alberto Chiarini](https://www.math.unipd.it/~chiarini/).

#       _"I sill feel deep down within me that I want to do something impossible, something difficult, something hard. That is my soul speaking to me, my growth challenging me, my potential screaming at me that it is not being utilised. I want to dig deep inside of me and go and be great. I want to utilise that potential, to reach those goals of mine. I'm like a slingshot that's getting pulled back, and I'm getting stretched and stretched and stretched, and I'm ready to fire. There's an intensity inside of me that I have no outlet to pour into, and I want to start pouring: into my running, my writing, my speaking. I want to be a writer, a motivational speaker and a runner, but I don't want to just be that: I want to beÂ greatÂ atÂ that."_
