        I am working in the field of randomly fluctuating interfaces, which arises naturally in the context of coexistence of two homogeneous phases and is studied in a variety of statistical mechanics models describing both the phases and their interface.\
        I am currently working on the Gaussian free field in random environment with [Alberto Chiarini](https://www.math.unipd.it/~chiarini/).
